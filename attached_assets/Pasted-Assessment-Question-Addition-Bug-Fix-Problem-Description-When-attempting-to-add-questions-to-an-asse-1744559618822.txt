Assessment Question Addition Bug Fix
Problem Description
When attempting to add questions to an assessment after an attempt has been made, only an empty popup is displayed instead of the question creation interface. We need to:

Fix the existing "Add Question" functionality under assessments > edit assessments
Implement similar functionality for creating questions during the initial assessment creation

Technical Requirements
Bug Fix for Existing Functionality

Debug why the popup is empty when trying to add questions to an existing assessment
Ensure the question creation form loads properly in the popup
Handle any state management issues that might be causing the empty popup

Implementation for New Functionality

Add a "Create Questions" section during the initial assessment creation flow
Reuse existing question creation components to maintain consistency
Ensure state is properly managed between assessment creation and question creation

Approach

Examine the current implementation:

Check the component that renders the empty popup
Verify if data is being passed correctly to the popup
Look for any conditional rendering that might be failing


Fix the empty popup issue:

Ensure question form components are imported correctly
Verify that necessary props are passed to the popup component
Add error handling and logging to identify any runtime issues


Implement question creation during assessment creation:

Add a step in the assessment creation workflow for adding questions
Reuse the fixed question creation components
Create a proper state management solution to store temporary questions before assessment submission



Code Structure
Focus on these files:

src/components/assessments/EditAssessment.js (or similar) - Fix the popup issue
src/components/assessments/CreateAssessment.js (or similar) - Add new functionality
src/components/questions/QuestionForm.js (or similar) - Ensure it works in both contexts

Testing Scenarios

Edit an existing assessment with attempts and add new questions
Create a new assessment and add questions during creation
Verify questions are saved correctly in both scenarios
Test edge cases (no questions, many questions, different question types)

Implementation Notes

Use React state or context API for managing temporary questions during creation
Consider implementing a reusable questions management module that works in both contexts
Add appropriate error handling and user feedback for a smooth experience
